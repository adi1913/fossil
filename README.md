#A prompt for making an  AI  for debugging python for students 
Generate code for a Python-only AI Debugging Tool with these requirements:

Purpose:

Help students learn Python.

Should not give them the direct solution.

Should guide them by highlighting mistakes and explaining them.

Error Highlighting:

Detect syntax errors, logical errors, and common beginner mistakes.

Clearly point out where the error occurs in the code.

Explain the error in simple, student-friendly language.

Learning Support:

Instead of fixing the code directly, suggest multiple alternative approaches.

Show different correct patterns/examples without pasting the exact solution.

Encourage experimentation and problem-solving.

Design:

Modern, clean, and modular Python code.

Well-structured functions and classes.

Extensible so more features can be added later.

User Interaction:

Input: student provides Python code (as text).

Output: feedback includes

Highlighted errors

Explanations of why they occur

Alternative approaches

Encouragement/hints

Restrictions:

Must only support Python code debugging (not other languages).

Must avoid giving away direct fixes.

Should feel like a learning companion, not an auto-correct tool.

Documentation:

Add clear comments in the code explaining how each part works.

Keep code readable and student-friendly.
